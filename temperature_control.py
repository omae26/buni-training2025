    TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM:
    > Components:
        - Raspberry Pi Pico MCU
        - DHT22 sensor, Relay and signal LED
    > Operation:
        - Monitor temperature against a set threshold
        - Activates relay and turns ON signal LED when temperature exceeds set threshold.
        - Deactivates relay and turns OFF signal LED when temperature normalizes
